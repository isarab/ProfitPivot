# ProfitPivot
Dynamic profitability at a glance.

ProfitPivot dynamically shows the difference between unit cost and current market price of an asset, both in absolute term and in percentage. Traders can ascertain the profit level of a particular asset at a glance. Traders can input or change unit cost of the asset at any time directly through attribute settings. Previous bar close price will be used by default if the unit cost is not supplied.
